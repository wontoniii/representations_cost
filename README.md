# Evaluating the cost of feature collection

In this lab, you will work through the steps necessary to evaluate the systems cost of collecting statistics from raw network traffic. Using the provided [notebook](collection.ipynb) you will:

1. Learn how to execute cost evaluation using [Traffic Refinery](https://traffic-refinery.github.io).
2. Study the differences in cost for network and video features (as used by inference models for inferring the quality of video streaming services from encrypted traffic).
3. Create your own features and compare them.
